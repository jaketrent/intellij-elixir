## v0.3.1
* Enhancements
  * [#112](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/112) - File > New > Project From Existing Sources can be used in IntelliJ to setup the excludes, sources, tests, SDK and libraries for an Elixir project that has already been created with `mix new`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * [#114](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/114) - Operators can be qualified function names - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * [#118](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/114) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

## v0.3.0
* Enhancements
  * [#108](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/108) - `\x` is marked as an error in CharLists, CharList Heredocs, Strings, and String Heredocs, but not in any sigils. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * [#111](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/111) - New Elixir File will automatically underscore the camel case module name when creating the file name and will convert qualifying aliases before the last `.` to directories - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* Incompatible Changes
  * [#111](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/111) - New Elixir File validates that the name is a valid Alias, so each `.` separated part must start with a capital letter.  Previous New Elixir File validated that the name was a valid path, and so forced the name to be lowercase. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

## v0.2.1
* Enhancements
  * [#105](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/105) - No parentheses function calls can occur as the right operand in binary infix operations or the sole operand of unary prefix operation. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

    * Quick Fix for the ambiguous parentheses to remove the space between the function name and the opening parentheses.

    * Inspection that marks errors for missing end-of-expressions (`;` and newlines) between expressions.
    * Quick Fix to insert `;` for missing end-of-expression.
    * Quick Fix to insert newline for missing end-of-expression.
* Bug Fixes
  * [#74](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/74) - Right hand-side of `dot_alias` and `dot_identifier`
    was translated incorrectly. Only Aliases and Identifiers are allowed now. [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
